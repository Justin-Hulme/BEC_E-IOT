## Overview

This project is focused on building a custom embedded control system using ESP8266/ESP32 microcontrollers. It provides a robust communication framework with TCP/UDP support for sending commands, telemetry, and video data. Key features include:

- Persistent TCP connections for command control
- Optional UDP for high-speed data transmission
- Dynamic handling of commands and arguments
- WiFi configuration via a soft AP and web interface
- EEPROM-based storage for credentials and server information
- Custom packet structure for reliable data transfer

---

## Current Status

- Core communication protocols implemented
- Command registration and packet handling in progress
- WiFi soft AP setup with credential submission working
- Video streaming and OTA updates planned
